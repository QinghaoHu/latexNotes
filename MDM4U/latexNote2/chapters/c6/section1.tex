\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{definition}[Normal Distribution]
    The properties of normal distributions can be described as this:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Graphical displays are mound-shaped histograms that are also \textbf{Bell-Shaped}
        \item The MEAN, MEDIAN and MODE fall on the line of symmetry
        \item Denoted by the notation $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation
        \item Modelled by a \textbf{NORMAL CURVE} where the curve passes through the midpoint of the top of each bar of the histogram of the data.
        \item The stadnard normal curve has a mean of $0$ and a standard deviation of $1$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
