\section{Approximate Hypergeometric}
If the population size $N$ is fairly large, and the sample size is relatively small, we can use a \underline{Normal Distribution}
to simulate \underline{Hypergeometric}
\begin{theorem}
    If $X$ is a hypergometric random distribution of $n$ independent trials, each with probability of success $p$,
    and if
    \begin{gather*}
        \frac{n}{N} < \tfrac{1}{10}\\
        n(1 - p) > 5
    \end{gather*}
    then the binomial random variable can be approximated by a normal distribution with 
    \begin{gather*}
        \mu = np\\
        \sigma = \sqrt{np(1 - p)}
    \end{gather*}
\end{theorem}
