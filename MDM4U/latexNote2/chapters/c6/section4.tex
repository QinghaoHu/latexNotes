\section{Approximate Hypergeometric}
If the population size $N$ is fairly large, and the sample size is relatively small, we can use a \underline{Normal Distribution}
to simulate \underline{Hypergeometric}
\begin{theorem}
    Given that $N$ is the population size, $n$ is the sample size, and $a$ is the number of elements in the population 
    with the particular characteristic, if
    \begin{gather*}
       \frac{n}{N} < \tfrac{1}{10}\\
       n\frac{a}{N} > 5\\
       n(\frac{N - a}{N}) > 5
    \end{gather*}
    then the hypergeometric random variable can be approximated by a normal distribution with 
    \begin{gather*}
        \mu = \frac{an}{N}\\
        \sigma = \sqrt{
            n(\frac{a}{N})(\frac{N - a}{N})(\frac{N - n}{N - 1})
        }
    \end{gather*}
\end{theorem}
