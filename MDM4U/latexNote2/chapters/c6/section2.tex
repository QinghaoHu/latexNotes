\section{Normal Modelling}
In the test, you definitely have no \underline{graphing calculator}. How can hack can we solve for the 
probablity of Normal Distribution between two region. At this time, we can use \underline{Z-score} 

\begin{theorem}
    Assume we have a normal distribution, $N \sim X(\mu, \sigma^2)$, we want to solve for
    \begin{equation}
        P(x \leq X) \label{probablity6.2.1}
    \end{equation}

    First we need to solve for \underline{z-score} of $X$
    \begin{equation*}
        Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}\\
    \end{equation*}

    After we have the \underline{z-score}, we can rewrite \ref{probablity6.2.1}:
    \begin{equation*}
        P(z \leq Z)
    \end{equation*}

    Then use your \underline{z-score} table to find the value correspond to this \underline{z-score}.\\
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
    How to use \underline{z-score} to solve for some special $P$:
    \begin{gather*}
        P(X_1 < x < X_2) = P(x < X_2) - P(x < X_1)\\
        P(X_1 > x) = 1 - P(x < X_1)
    \end{gather*}
\end{theorem}

For discrete data, always perform $+/-0.5$
