\section{Apply linear Regression}
\subsubsection{Outliers}
When you handle outliers, a good way is to creating two models to describe the relationship, one model includes
the outliers and the other does not. 

\subsection{RESIDUAL}
The \textbf{Residual} values that correspond to each respective data from a LINEAR regression can be used to create graph, called a \textbf{residual plot}, where the line of best fit is the horizontal axis 
 of the plot. A residual plot helps us assess the fit of a regression line. If its pattern in the plot is an unstructured horizontal band centered at zero (the centre of the residuals), then the regression
 line fits the data well. If its pattern has a curve, then the relationship is non-linear rather than linear; hence, a straight line is not a good model for such relationshp.

\subsubsection{Formula for Residual}
\begin{equation}
    \text{Residual} = \sum (y - y_{est})
