\section{Linear Regression}
\subsection{Residual}
\begin{definition}
    (Residual): It is the difference between the observed value and the value predicted by the best fit line. (Ie. how "far off" is the line, vertically, 
    from the point)
\end{definition}

Points abouve the line have \textbf{positive} residuals and points below the line have negative residuals.\\

There are some really good sample questions on teacher's handouts. You should check it though!

\subsection{Regression}
\begin{definition}
    (Linear Regression): an analytic technique to determine a model that can used to describe the linear correlation between two quantitative variables. 
\end{definition}

The linear model produced by linear regression is called a \textbf{least-squares} line.\\

For a least-square line, there are certain properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the residuals add to $0$ and the sum of the squares of the residuals is \textbf{Minimized}
    \item the slope is defined as 
    \begin{gather}
        a = \frac{s_{xy}}{(s_x)^2} \nonumber
    \end{gather}
    \item the y-intercept is defined as 
    \begin{equation}
        b = \bar{y} - a\bar{x} \nonumber
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}
