\section{Cofficient of Determination}
\subsection{Defintions}
The \textbf{Correlation coefficient} (i.e the r value) is a measure of the linearity of the data. However, the coefficient of determination ($R^2$)
is defined such that it applies on any type of relationships, linear or non-linear. \\

The coefficient of \textbf{determination} ranges for 0 to 1. It measures what percent of the variation of the dependent variables is due to the variation 
in the independent variable. It is the ratio of the explained variation to the total variation. 

\subsubsection{The equation of Cofficient of Determination}
\begin{gather}
    R^2 = \frac{
        \sum (y_{est} - \bar{y})^2
    }{
        n - 1
    } : \frac{
        \sum (y - \bar{y})^2
    }{
        n - 1
    } = \frac{
        \sum (y_{est} - \bar{y})^2
    }{
        \sum (y - \bar{y})^2
    }
\end{gather}
\begin{center}
    $y_{est}$ is the value estimated by the line/curve of best fit and $y$ is the actual given y-value
