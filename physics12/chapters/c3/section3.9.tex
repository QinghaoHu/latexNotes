\section{HEAD-ON Collisions}
\subsection{Equations}
Under this section, I will derive Equations that is useful to solve for final velocity for each object when you have initial velocity for a \text{HEAD-ON Collision} question

\begin{redblock}
    The equation for $\vec{v_A}'$
   \begin{gather}
    \vec{v_A}' = \frac{m_A - m_B}{m_A + m_B} * \vec{v_A}
   \end{gather}
   The equation for $\vec{v_B}'$
   \begin{gather}
    \vec{v_B}' = \frac{2m_A}{m_A + m_B} * \vec{v_A}
   \end{gather}
\end{redblock}

For questions which $\vec{v_B}$ is not zero, we need change Frame of Reference to $\vec{v_B}$ in order to solve the question. And change the FOR back later.
