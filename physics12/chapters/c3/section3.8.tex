\section{Types of Collisions}
\subsection{Definitions}
Collisions are typically classified based on the amount of \textbf{kinetic energy} the syste has after the 
collision, in comparsion to the amount of kinetic energy the system had before the collision. In other words,
\textbf{how does $E_k'$ with $E_{k}$}?

\subsection{Elastic Collisions}
In an elastic collision, the kinetic energy of the system after the collision is \textbf{equal} to the kinetic
energy of the system before the collision. In mathematics, the equation can be represented by:
\begin{gather*}
    E_k' = E_k
\end{gather*}

\begin{remark}
    This does not mean the kinetic energy of the system after the collision is \textbf{equal} to the kinetic 
    energy of the system before the collision (Unlike momentum)
\end{remark}

\subsubsection{Steps of the collision}
\textbf{Before the collision}:The mechancial of energy is entirely in the form of kinetic energy
