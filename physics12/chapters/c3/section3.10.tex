\section{Real Gravational Potential Energy}

\subsection{Definitions}
In earlier time in this unit, we studied a formula for Gravational Potential Energy
\begin{equation}
    E_g = mgh
\end{equation}

In fact, there are few problems with our old formula:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It assumes that $g$ is constat (it change as the distance above the Earth's surface changes)
    \item the formula uses a reference location which we define. This is not an absolute location, where $E_g$ is 0
\end{enumerate}

So, let's derive for the new equation of Gravational Potential Energy\\

Consider a satellite of mass $m_s$ at a large distance $r$ from the centre of planet Eart (mass $M_e$)
