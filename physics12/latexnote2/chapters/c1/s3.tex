\section{Adding and Subtracting 2-Dimensional Vectors}
\subsection{Vector addition and subtraction key words}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[+] Addition: Find "the \textbf{resultant}", "the total", or "the net". 
    \item[-] Subtraction: Find "the \textbf{difference}" or "the change in".
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Steps for solving a vector problem}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Read the question carefully
    \item Show unit conventions
    \item Write "givens" (It helps to roughly sketch each vector and their compoents)
    \item Set direction conventions
    \item Solve for each compoents (ex. $\Delta\vec{d_{1y}}, \Delta\vec{d_{2x}}$)
    \item Choose one component direction (ex. Just the 'x' direction) and solve the equations for that direction
    \item Repeat with the other direction
    \item Sketch your resulting $x$ and $y$ vectors, joining them head-to-tail. 
    \item Calculate the magnitude and direction of the resultant. (Trigonometry)
    \item State the final answer, including the real-world direction
\end{enumerate}
