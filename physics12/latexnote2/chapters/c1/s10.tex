\section{Tension, compression and Pulleys}
\textbf{\textit{Internal Forces}} are Netwon's third Law pair of forces that act inside of an object or a system of objects
that are in contact with each other. \\

According to the Netwon's third law, when we analyze the system, the sum of the forces equals 0. 
Thus, these forces will have no impact on the net force acting on the system and will have 
\textbf{\textit{no effect on the system's acceleration}}

\subsection{Tention: T}
If one object is pulling the other object then you are dealing with \textbf{Tension}.

\subsection{Compression: C}
If one object is pushing the other object then you are dealing with \textbf{Compression}
