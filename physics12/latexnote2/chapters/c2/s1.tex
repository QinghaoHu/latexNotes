\section{Proportionality}
\begin{definition}
    Proportionality is concerned witht he relationship between two different variables in an equation. It is the method 
    of showing the \textbf{effective change} in the values of the \textbf{independent variables} will have on the \textbf{dependent variable}
\end{definition}

Proportionality is entirely based on \textbf{multiplication}. If the value of the independent variable is multiplied by a 
\textbf{specific factor}, then the value of the dependent variable will be multiplied by some mathematical operation of that factor. 

\subsubsection*{Direct Proportionality}
In this graph, the proportionality will make a straight line\\

Mathematical expression:
\[
    x \propto y
\]

\subsubsection*{Square Proportionality}
Read "$x$ is proportional to the square of $y$"\\

The graph looks like half of a quadratic function\\

\[
    x \propto y^2
\]

\subsubsection*{Square root proportionality}
Half of a square root function\\

"$x$ is proportional to the square root of $y$"\\

\[
    x \propto \sqrt{y}
\]

\subsubsection*{Inverse square proportionality}
Looks like a rational function\\
\begin{gather*}
    x \propto \frac{1}{y}\\
     x \propto \frac{1}{y^2}\\
      x \propto \frac{1}{y^31}\\
\end{gather*}
