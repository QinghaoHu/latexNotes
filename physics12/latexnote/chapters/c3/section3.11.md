# Black Holes 
[Kick here to review teacher's note](https://classroom.google.com/w/NzM2OTg1NjAzNDk2/t/all)
## Definitions
### Intermediate to Large-Mass stars:
The core temperature is high enough to produce elements heavier than carbon. The fusion process continues will until **iron** is produced. This causes the fusion process to stop abruptly 

- Star's temperature decreases very rapidly. 
- The Outer layers of get **drawn toward the core at very high speed**
- Then, they collide with the core, which causes the fusion process to begin again. (Heavier elements are produced)
- The gas then **rebounds** from the core and get flung out into space -> this is called a supernova

### Once the fusion stops:
#### If the star is imtermediate size:
- The force of gravity in the core is so strong that electrons are pulled out of their oribts. 
- Electrons then combine with protons in the nucleus, to form neutrons -> A neutron star is formed
#### If the original star was large (greater than 20 times the mass of sun)
- Force of gravity is so large that the neutrons get drawn into each other
- All of the mass at the core get drawn into a **singularity** 
A block hole formed

### Does blackhole have a stronger gravitational field tha the star it came from?
Depends on the position!
#### If you stay outside the original star
- The star had a stronger grav.field because a black hole has less total mass than the original .
- So weaker gravational field.

#### The location where very close to singularity
- Much stronger
This is the formula solve for the strength of gravational field 
$$
    g = \frac{
        GM
    }{
        R^2
    }
$$

If we approach to the singularity , the distance approaches to 0
The $g$ approaches to $\infty$

Eventuraly nothing can escape 

The closet point which light can still have enough energy to escape is called **The event Horizon**

The distance from the singularity to the event horizon is the Schwarzschild Radius (Rs)

$$
E_{m1} = E_{m2}\\
0 = E_{k} + E_g\\
0 = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 + (-\frac{GMm}{R_s})\\
0 = \frac{1}{2}c^2 - \frac{GM}{R_s}\\
R_s = \frac{2GM}{c^2}
$$
M is the mass of the blackhole
c is $3.0 * 10^8$
$R_s$ is the Schwarzschild Radius ($R_s$)
