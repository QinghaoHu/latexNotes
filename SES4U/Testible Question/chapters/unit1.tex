\section{The Sun}
\subsection{Question 1}
    Which of the following explains why the sun's corona is much hotter than photosphere:\\
    \red{Energy from the Sun's magnetic field heats the outer layer}

\subsection{Question 2}
Which process is reponsible for the sun's energy production:\\
\red{Nuclear fusion of hydrogen in to helium}

\subsection{Question 3}
Why do sunspots appear darker than the surrounding region of the sun's surface and what cause them:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \red{Sunspots look darker because they are cooler}
    \item \red{Strong magnetic fields in this region block the normal flow of hot plasma}
\end{itemize}

\section{Stellar Evolution}
\subsection{Question 1}
Which of the following is not affected directly by a star's mass?:\\
\red{Chemical Composition}

\subsection{Question 2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \red{Nuclear fusion at the core creates pressure that pushes outward on a star, while the star's mass causes gravity to pull inwards on the star}
    \item \red{These two forces balanced out}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Question 3}
If the cores of supergiant stars can only fuse elements up to iron, why do heavier elements exist in the universe?
\red{During supernova}

\section{Black Holes}
\subsection{Question 1}
What did Einstein say about gravity in his general theory of relativity?\\
\red{Gravity is a curvature in space-time caused by its mass}

\subsection{Question 2}
Why blackhole cannot be seen with the naked eye, scientists can still find a black hole's size and location:\\
\red{Through some methods:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Observe a black hole's effect on objects surrounding it, including its gravitational pull and how it impacts a star's orbit
    \item Measure the x-ray emitted from the hot gass inside the blackhole
    \item Measure the gravitational waves given off when toe black holes collide
\end{enumerate}

\section{The Milky Way Galaxy}
\subsection{Question 1}
Where is our solar system located in the Milky Way Galaxy? \\
\red{In a smaller spiral arm called the Orion Arm}
