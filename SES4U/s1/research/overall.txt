The presentation structure should follow this:
    Perfect! We can shift the focus toward myths and keep late 19th-century content short. Here‚Äôs a **revised 30-minute structure**:

---

### **1. Introduction & Hook (3 min)**

* Open with a myth or story about the cosmos (e.g., Greek/Roman myths about Sun and Moon).
* Explain the seminar topic and roadmap.

---

### **2. Pre-Science Space Science & Myths (6‚Äì7 min)**

* Ancient myths about the heavens: Greek, Roman, possibly Egyptian or Chinese.
* Transition to early scientific attempts to explain the cosmos.
* Ancient Greek space science. 
* Geocentric models (Aristotle, Ptolemy).
* Early hints at heliocentrism (Aristarchus).

---

### **3. Heliocentric System (12‚Äì13 min)**

* Copernicus‚Äô model: Sun-centered universe.
* Evidence: Galileo‚Äôs observations, Kepler‚Äôs laws.
* Opposition from religious and academic authorities.
* Visual aid: comparison diagram of geocentric vs heliocentric.
* Optional: short story of how myths and old beliefs conflicted with science.

---

### **4. Late 19th-Century Space Science (2 min)**

* Very brief: observational advances, new understanding of stars and nebulae.
* Emphasize that heliocentrism was fully accepted, science moved toward modern astrophysics.

---

### **5. Connections & Reflection (3 min)**

* Connect myths ‚Üí heliocentrism ‚Üí modern understanding.
* Emphasize evolution of human thought about the cosmos.

---

- Game time

### **6. Conclusion (2 min)**

* Summarize key points.
* End with a ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù takeaway: from myth to observation, humanity‚Äôs view of the universe changed dramatically.

---

üí° **Tips for delivery:**

* Open and close with a myth to give your talk a nice ‚Äústory arc.‚Äù
* Keep visuals for complex ideas: geocentric vs heliocentric, Galileo‚Äôs moons, Kepler‚Äôs orbits.
* Practice timing to ensure myths + heliocentric system don‚Äôt exceed \~20 minutes together.

If you want, I can **make a full slide-by-slide breakdown** with timings, visuals, and myth integration ‚Äî basically a ready-to-use 30-minute seminar script.

Do you want me to do that?
