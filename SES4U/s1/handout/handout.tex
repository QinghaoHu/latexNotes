\section*{History of Space Science to 1700s}

\subsection*{Expectations}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Describe how early cultures created \fillin{3cm} to explain the universe.
  \item Explain the differences between the \fillin{3cm} System and \fillin{3cm} System.
  \item Describe how humans' understanding of the universe developed in \fillin{4cm}.
  \item Describe how each scientist contributed to the \fillin{3cm} and \fillin{3cm} systems.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Myths}
At the beginning of mankind, early civilizations did not understand modern science. 
They created \fillin{3cm} to explain the universe.

\paragraph{Example I: Pangu Creates the World}
\begin{itemize}
  \item From \fillin{3cm}.
  \item Pangu used his hands and legs to break the chaos.
  \item His \fillin{2cm} eye became the Sun.
  \item His \fillin{2cm} eye became the Moon.
  \item His \fillin{2cm} became the soil.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Example II: The Turtle Island Myth}
\begin{itemize}
  \item From \fillin{4cm}.
  \item The Earth was formed on the back of a giant \fillin{2.5cm} -- ``Turtle Island''.
  \item A woman gave birth to twins.
  \item The \fillin{2cm} Twin placed the Sun in the sky for \fillin{3cm}.
  \item The \fillin{2cm} Twin placed the Moon in the sky for \fillin{3cm}.
  \item Such myths explained the \fillin{3cm} before scientific astronomy.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Ancient Greek Astronomy}
\paragraph{Eudosus (390–337 BCE)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Proposed the first geometric model of planetary motion.
  \item Used \fillin{2cm} concentric spheres with Earth at the center.
  \item First to use \fillin{3cm} and \fillin{3cm} to analyze the heavens.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Aristotle (384–322 BCE)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Expanded Eudosus's model using about \fillin{2cm} concentric spheres.
  \item Earth is a \fillin{2cm} and \fillin{2.5cm} at the universe's center.
  \item Everything travels in \fillin{3cm}.
  \item The universe is \fillin{3cm} and finite.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Ptolemy (100–170 AD)}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Developed the \fillin{3cm} Model.
  \item Introduced \fillin{3cm} to explain \fillin{3cm}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Heliocentric System}
\paragraph{Copernicus}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Proposed the \fillin{3cm} Universe.
  \item Planets arranged by \fillin{3cm}.
  \item \fillin{3cm} explained by Earth’s motion, no epicycles needed.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Tycho Brahe}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Built \fillin{3cm}.
  \item Proposed a \fillin{3cm} model.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Johannes Kepler}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Showed planetary orbits are \fillin{2.5cm}.
  \item Laws of Planetary Motion: \fillin{5cm}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Galileo Galilei}
\begin{itemize}
  \item First to use a \fillin{3cm} for astronomy.
  \item Discovered moons of \fillin{3cm}.
  \item Opposed the \fillin{3cm} model.
  \item Condemned by the \fillin{3cm}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Student Activity II}
