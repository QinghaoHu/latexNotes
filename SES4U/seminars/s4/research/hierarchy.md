# The Hierarchy 
## Eon
### Definition of Eon
> Eons are used when Earth undergos massive, planet-wide transformation.
> Ex. The formation of the crust, the rise of oxygen in the atmosphere, the appearance of complex life. 

### Examples
#### Pre-Archean
> __(4.54 ~ 4.0 billion years ago)__
> Extreme heat, magma oceans, constant impacts. 
> Our Earth began to cool and solidify 
> First atmosphere and early oceans being forming (late pre-archean)
> Earth change from non-existent to a physical planet
#### Archean
> __(4.0 Billion years ~ 2.5 Billion years ago)__
> Stable crust and ocean form
> First life appear (simple microbial life)
> atmosphere remains oxygen free
> life starts interarcing with Earth's surface
> Earth changes from a hostile planet -> a living planet
#### Proterzoic Eon 
>__(2.5 Billion years ~ 541 million years ago)__
> Oxygen accumulates in the atmosphere
> First Eukaryotic cells appear
> First multicellular organisms evolve 
> Extreme global climate events
> From a microbial, oxygen poor world -> a planet capable of complex life.
#### Phanerozoic
> __(541 million years ago ~ present)__
> Life spread onto land
> Complex ecosystem form (forests, reefs, food chains)
> Life strongly influence climate and geology 
> Earth becomes a planet where complex life is obvious in the fossil record
>
## ERA
### Definition of ERA
>A subdivision of an eon that represents a major global chang ein life, climate, o0r geology, but smaller 
transformations that define eons

## **Archean Eon – Eras**

### **Early Archean (4.0–3.6 billion years ago)**

> Earth cools enough for stable oceans and an early crust to form.
> Conditions become suitable for the first simple life.

### **Middle Archean (3.6–3.0 billion years ago)**

> Microbial life becomes widespread in the oceans.
> Stromatolites form and Earth’s surface becomes more stable.

### **Late Archean (3.0–2.5 billion years ago)**

> Oxygen-producing cyanobacteria spread widely.
> Oxygen begins changing Earth’s chemistry, preparing for the next eon.

## **Proterozoic Eon – Eras**

### **Early Proterozoic (2.5–1.6 billion years ago)**

> Oxygen accumulates in the atmosphere during the Great Oxidation Event.
> Earth’s oceans and atmosphere undergo permanent chemical change.


### **Middle Proterozoic (1.6–1.0 billion years ago)**

> The first eukaryotic (nucleated) cells appear.
> Life becomes more complex but evolves slowly.

### **Late Proterozoic (1.0 billion–541 million years ago)**

## **Archean Eon – Eras**

### **Eoarchean (4.0–3.6 billion years ago)**

> Earth cools enough for stable oceans and an early crust to form.
> The planet becomes barely habitable for the first time.

---

### **Paleoarchean (3.6–3.2 billion years ago)**

> Clear evidence of microbial life appears in the oceans.
> Life becomes established and widespread in shallow waters.

---

### **Mesoarchean (3.2–2.8 billion years ago)**

> Microbial ecosystems expand and stabilize globally.
> Earth’s surface and climate become more stable.

---

### **Neoarchean (2.8–2.5 billion years ago)**

> Oxygen-producing cyanobacteria spread widely in the oceans.
> Oxygen begins altering Earth’s chemistry, preparing for the next eon.

---

## **Proterozoic Eon – Eras**

### **Paleoproterozoic (2.5–1.6 billion years ago)**

> Oxygen accumulates in the atmosphere during the Great Oxidation Event.
> Earth’s atmosphere and oceans are permanently transformed.

---

### **Mesoproterozoic (1.6–1.0 billion years ago)**

> The first eukaryotic (nucleated) cells appear.
> Life becomes more complex, but evolution remains slow.

---

### **Neoproterozoic (1.0 billion–541 million years ago)**

> Extreme global ice ages reshape Earth’s climate.
> The first multicellular organisms evolve.

---

## **Phanerozoic Eon – Eras**

### **Paleozoic (541–252 million years ago)**

> Complex life rapidly diversifies during the Cambrian Explosion.
> Life spreads from the oceans onto land.

---

### **Mesozoic (252–66 million years ago)**

> Dinosaurs become the dominant land animals.
> The era ends with a mass extinction that reshapes life on Earth.

---

### **Cenozoic (66 million years ago–present)**

> Mammals and birds diversify and dominate ecosystems.
> Humans evolve during Earth’s modern biological era.
