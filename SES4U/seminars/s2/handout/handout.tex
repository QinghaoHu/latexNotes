\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{US respond to the SPUTNIK 1(1958)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Soviet Union's achievements did not cause us any \fillin{3cm}; they simply sent a small ball into space.
    \item Finally, three month later, the United States sent an even \fillin{3cm} satellite to the space

    \item Soviet press downplayed it as a short "Up and Down" hop
\end{itemize}
