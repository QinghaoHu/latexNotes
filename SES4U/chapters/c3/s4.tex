\section{Earthquakes}
\subsection{Terminology}
\begin{definition}[Focus]
    Where the earthquake starts.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Epicentre]
    The location on the surface directly above the surface. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    [Seismographs] Instrument used to record the motion of the ground during an earthquake
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    [Seismogram] The graph which is recorded by the \underline{seismograph}
\end{definition}

The tools can allow us to measure the intensity of earthquakes! The scale that is commonly used is called the \underline{Ricter Scale}
\\

The scale involves measuring the \underline{amplitude} of the largest wave at a specific distance from the \underline{epicentre}

\begin{remark}
    \underline{Ricter Scale} is a quantity way to measure the \underline{intensity} of the earthquake
\end{remark}

\subsection{Waves}
These waves are ranked by their speed:

\subsubsection{Body wave}
\begin{definition}
    [P-Wave] Parallel to the direction of the wave (forward + backward)
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    [S Wave] Perpendicular to the direction of the wave (side by side)
\end{definition}

\subsubsection{Surface wave}
\begin{definition}
    [Love wave] Like water wave
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
    [raylight] Rotate under ground
\end{definition}
