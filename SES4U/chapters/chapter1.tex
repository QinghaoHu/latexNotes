\section{Measuing the Universe}

\subsection{Some important constants}
The speed of light $c$:
\[
    c = 3.00 * 10^8\frac{m}{s} (3SD)
\]
The distance of a light year:
\[
    \text{A light year} = 9.4608 * 10^{15} m (3SD)
\]
The distance between \textcolor{red}{Earth} and \textcolor{red}{Sun} refers to the \textit{Astronomicial Unit (AU)}
\[
    AU = 1.4958 * 10^{11}m (3SD)
\]
One Parsec is \textcolor{red}{3.26} light years \[
\text{Parsec} = 3.0824 * 10^{16}m (3SD)
\]

\subsection{Unit Conversion}
\begin{example}
    If 1 inch = 2.54 cm, then 4.5 inches is equivalent to how many cm? \\
    \[
    4.5 \text{ inch } * \frac{2.54cm}{1\text{ }inch} = 11.43 \text{ }cm
    \]
    $\therefore 1 \text{ } inch = 11.43 cm$
\end{example}

\subsection{Radar}
This method is very accurate, it can measure the distance to the moon with an \textcolor{blue}{3 cm} precision!\\

Using radar in Astronomy has some limitations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Electromagnetic waves tend to \textcolor{blue}{\textit{spread out with distance}} causing weaker signals
    \item The furthest we can measure with this technique is \textcolor{blue}{with a few AUs}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Parallex}
Parallax refers to how closer objects appear to move compared to farther away objects. This is commonly used in video games
to give the illusion of depth.\\

\mypic{pictures/parallex.png}{Parallax}{0.8}

If we measure the angles that a star shifts using arcseconds, we arrive at how the \textcolor{red}{persec is defined}

\begin{gather}
    d = \frac{1}{p}
\end{gather}

\begin{center}
    $d$ = distance in Parsec\\
    $p$ = parallax angle in arcseconds
\end{center}

\textit{Remainder: The distance that can accurately be measured from the Earth using parallax is \textbf{\textcolor{red}{100}} parsecs.}

\section{Cepheid Variable Stars, Redshift and Hubble's Law}
\subsection{Apparent Magnitude and Absolute Magnitude}
In this chapter, I will directly define few terms:

\begin{definition}
   Apparent magnitude = \textit{\textcolor{blue}{How bright an object appears from Earth's surface}}
\end{definition}
\mypic{pictures/ApparentMagnitude.png}{Apparent magnitude (m)}{1}

\begin{definition}
    Absolute Magnitude: How bright an object would appear if it was \textit{\textcolor{blue}{exactly 10 parsecs away}}
\end{definition}

\subsection{Cepheid Variable stars}
\begin{definition}
    Cepheids: Special stars that change how luminous they are at regular time intervals
\end{definition}

Cepheids "pulsate" with \textcolor{blue}{periods} ranging from 1 to 100 days

\subsection{Determining absolute magnitudes using Cepheld Variables}
Absolute magnitudes of stars can be determined using cephelds. It was discovered that period of pulsation is directly related to the star's \textit{lumonosity}

\begin{beamerblock}
    \begin{definition}
         \blue{lumonosity}: The amount of energy emitted by a star each second.
    \end{definition}
\end{beamerblock}

\begin{center}
    \blue{longer} periods have \blue{higher} luminosities
\end{center}

Cepheid Variables are also called "standard candles". Using this method, we can determine distances from 1000 parsecs up to 50 million parsecs

\subsection{Hubble's Law}
Hubble's Law states that:
\begin{center}
    The \blue{further} away and object is, the \blue{faster moving away from us.}
\end{center}

Hubble's law:
\[
    v = Hd
\]
\begin{center}
    $v$ = velocity of object in $km/h$\\
    $d$ = distance in megaparsecs (Mpc)\\
    (1 Mpc = 1 million pc)\\
    $H$ = Hubble's constant
\end{center}

If the velocity of an object is known, we can then calculate their distance.

\subsection{Redshift} 
Luckily, people can determine the the velocity of fast-moving objects with \blue{Redshift}\\
Remember, Doppler Effect causes red shifts
