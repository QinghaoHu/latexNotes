\section{The Wonders of the Solar System}
The further a planet is from the sun, the \textbf{slower} it's speed, and the \textbf{longer} one revolution around the 
Sun takes. \\

The type of celestial object appears to change its position amongst the stars from night to night is called \textbf{planet}\\

When the Earth "overtakes" Mars in orbit, Mars appears to move \textbf{backward} against the backgrounds of the stars.\\

Everything in our solar system was formed from a \blue{nebula}, a giant \textbf{cloud} of gas and dust. \\

What type of event is thought to have disturbed the nebula and to have led to the formation of the solar system?\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item  A shock wave from a nearby supernova explosion. 
\end{itemize}

As cloud contrast, they spin \textbf{faster}. This happens according to the law of Conservation of Angular \textbf{momentum}\\

The ring \textbf{nearest} Saturn are the fartest., just like planets orbiting the Sun. \\

Whater material makes up Saturn's rings? \textbf{Water ice}\\

Much of Earth's \textbf{water} is believed to have been brought to Earth by impacts that occured during the Late Heavy Bombardment.
