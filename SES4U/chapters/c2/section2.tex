\section{Newton's Law of Gravitation}
\begin{remark}
If you took or are taking SPH4U, the easiest way to revew this section is "Go check your physics note"
\end{remark}

The equation for the Gravity:
\begin{gather}
    F_g = \frac{GMm}{R^2}
\end{gather}

The gravitational force acting between two objects is proportional to the \textbf{mass} of each object and inversely proportional to the 
\textbf{distance} betweem them squared"\\

The alrger the mass, the more force is required to accelerate it.\\

"Accelerate" means to change \textbf{speed} or \textbf{direction}\\

When two objects are closer related in mass, they will orbit each other!\\

Try to do some physics questions before the unit test.
