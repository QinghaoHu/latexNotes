\section{Friction}
In high school we deal with two types of friction: static and Kinetic

\subsection{Kinetic Friction}
Used when the two surfaces that are in contact are \textit{slides relative to each other}.
\begin{equation}
    F_{fk} = \mu_{fk} * F_{n}
\end{equation}

Kinetic friction on an object can make an object \underline{slow down} or \underline{speed up}

\subsection{Static Friction}
Used when the two surfaces are \underline{Not Sliding} relative to each other
\begin{equation}
    F_{fs.max} = \mu_{fs} * F_{n}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Remainder}
Don't forget to mention to prove \underline{$F_{N} = F_{g}$}
