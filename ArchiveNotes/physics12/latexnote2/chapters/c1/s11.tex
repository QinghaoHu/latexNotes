\section{Inclined plane with Friction}
To deal with inclined plans with friction, you need to determine the direction that the system will likely to accelrate. 
\\

Think of this as \textbf{tug of war} between these 2 forces,. Whichever force has a greater magnitude will be the direction that the system will 
likely to \textbf{accelerate}

\subsection{How to determine the direction that the system will likely to accelerate}
Look at the \textcolor{blue}{forces} acting on the system. (Active forces are forces that are \textit{trying to make the system move})
\textcolor{red}{Do not include internal forces} \\

Along the potential line of the system's acceleration:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Find the sum of the active forces, which are in one Dimension
    \item Find the sum of the active forces which are acting in the opposite direction
\end{itemize}
Compare the magnitude of these two force sums, and whichever direction has the larger magnitude of active forces is the directions that 
system is likely to accelerate

\subsection{Example template}
\begin{center}
    Active forces[label directions]\\
    Calculate for it\\
    Process$\cdots$\\
    Active forces[Label directions]\\
    Calculate for it\\
    $\therefore$ the system will more likely to move in which direction. The friction will move $\cdots$
