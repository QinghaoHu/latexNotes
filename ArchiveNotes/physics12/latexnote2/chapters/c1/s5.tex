\section{Relative Velocities in Two Dimensions}
\subsection{Recall}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item All velocities are related to an F.O.R that we consider to be \textcolor{red}{motionless or stopped}
    \item A frame of reference is just a \textcolor{red}{perspective} from which we observe/or measure the motion of objects
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Definition}
We sometimes refer to something that another thing can travel through as \textit{medium}. We also sometimes refer to the thing that is moving through the medium as \textit{object(O)}, and the 
ground use the symbol \textit(G)

Therefore the equation can be written as:
\[
\vec{v_{OG}} = \vec{v_{OM}} + \vec{v_{MG}}
\]
