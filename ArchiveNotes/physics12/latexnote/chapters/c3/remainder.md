# Here are some important noets you should remember
## 3.1 Work and Kinetic Energy
- Do not solve the conservation of energy problem involving a change of Frame of Reference. Start from your perspective
- $E_k$ is a scalar, (not a vector)
- __Positive work__ on a system means it receives energy from its surroundings
- __Negative work__ work on a system means it gave energy to its surroundings 
- __Positive work__ work occurs when the force has a component in the direction opposite the displacement

You should always write $\cos \theta$ in the work function

## 3.2 Gravitational Protential Energy
- Only use one form of these formulas:
$$
 E_g = mgh
$$ and 
$$
 \Delta E_g = mg\Delta h
$$

## 3.3 The law of the Conservation of Energy
__The law of the conservation of energy only works in a closed isolated system. In raelity, the only true closed system is our Universe!__

For each question related to the conservation of energy, you should always start with this:
$$
    E_{m1} = E_{m2}\\
    E_{k2} + E_{g2} = E_{k1} + E_{g1} + W_{ap} + W_{f}
$$

## 3.4 String & Elastic Potential Energy
Nothing really to say

## 3.5 Simple Harmonic Motion
- When use all the formulas in this class, remember, you need to use $\vec{a} \text{ and } \vec{x}$

### Here is a brief discussion about why we can remove GPE
If we set $x_{eq}$ to 0, we can ignore the force of gravity and the Gravitational Potential Energy. 
$$
E_{s}(\text{ set $x_{eq}$ to 0 }) = E_{s} + E_{g}
$$
