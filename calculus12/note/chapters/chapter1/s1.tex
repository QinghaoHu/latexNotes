\subsection{Measuring Rates of Change on a Table or a Graph}
In Grade 9, we all studied the slope formula: 
\[
    m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]
$m$ represents the slope because linear function is written as:
\[
    f(x) = mx + b
\]

\subsubsection{Intervial of the function}
When you are asked to give the intervial of a function, one must response in one of these forms:
\[
x \in (-\infty, a) \cap (b, \infty)
\]
