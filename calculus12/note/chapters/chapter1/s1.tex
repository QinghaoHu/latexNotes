\subsection{Measuring Rates of Change on a Table or a Graph}
\begin{definition}
    [slope/Rate of Change] the ratio of the vertical distance to the horizontal distance between two points. 
\end{definition}
In Grade 9, we all studied the slope formula: 
\[
    m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]
$m$ represents the slope because linear function is written as:
\[
    f(x) = mx + b
\]

\subsubsection{Intervial of the function}
When you are asked to give the intervial of a function, one must response in one of these forms:
\[
x \in (-\infty, a) \cap (b, \infty)
\]

\begin{remark}
    We look the function from $-\infty$ to $\infty$
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
    Here is a question by Mr.Hoken
    \begin{figure}[h!]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{pictures/1.1.1.png}
    \end{figure}

    \noindent The answer for a) should be $x \in (-\infty, -3)$\\
    The answer for b) should be $x \in (-\infty, -3) \cup (5, \infty)$\\

\end{example}

\subsubsection{Determine approximation for the slope of the tangent}
To start off, we need to two points which have equal difference of x to the point that tangent line cross over. \\

\noindent Let's assume we have points $1, 2, \text{ and } 3$. Point 2 touches the tangent line.\\
Solve for the slope between point 1 and point 2: 
\[
    m_1 = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]
Solve for the slope between point 2 and point 3:
\[
    m_2 = \frac{y_3 - y_2}{x_3 - x_2}
\]
The slope at point 2 that touches tangent line should be: 
\begin{gather*}
    m = \frac{m_2 + m_1}{2} 
\end{gather*}

\subsubsection{Trends and increasing/decreasing}
Here are the summary Mr. Hoken made for this class
\begin{itemize}
    \item An increasing trend in y values corresponds to positive slopes of tangents in that intervial
    \item A decreasing trend in y values corresponds to negative slopes of tangents in that interval
    \item "Rate of Change" in y values refers to your slope values. We use standard expressions to describe the trend in Slope values
    \begin{itemize}
        \item [*] "The rate of change is increasing" means that the slope values are climbing.\\ 
        ex. (0.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 20, $\cdots$) or (-10, -9, $\cdots$, 1, 2)
        \item [*] "The rate of change is decreasing" means that the slope values are dropping.\\
        ex. (25, 11, 9, 5, $\cdots$, -3, -7, -20)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
